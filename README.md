# A/B Analysis Test Results
## Jupyter Notebook: Results of an A/B, e-commerce website, test.

Attempt to understand whether a given company should implement a new page or keep the old page with following steps:

### Probability-based approach
- A/B test
- Regression approach

### Requirements
1) Matplotlib 
2) Pandas
3) Python
4) Statsmodels 

#### Probability-based approach:

Attempt to find the probability of an individual receiving the new page or an old page and what are the chances of those.

#### A/B test:

Test a hypothesis, "Do new page results in better conversion or not?"
Simulate user groups with respect to conversions
Find the the p_value
Double check and validate results and decide whether to reject the null hypothesis


#### Regression Approach:

Explore two possible outcomes; 1) Keep the existing page; and/or, 2) Use the new page. Which one is better? Why? 
Factoring user's geo-location of the users, determine if any specific country had an impact on conversion?
