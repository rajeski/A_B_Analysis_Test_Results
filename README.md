# A/B Analysis Test Results
## Jupyter Notebook: A/B, e-commerce, website, test.

Attempt to understand whether a given company should implement a new webpage or keep the current webpage by:

### Probability-based approach
- A/B test
- Regression approach

### Requirements
1) Matplotlib 
2) Pandas
3) Python
4) Statsmodels 

#### Probability-based approach:

Attempt to find the probability of whether or not someone logging onto the organization's homepage receives the 
new webpage or the current webpage and what ate the odds between these two possibilities.

#### A/B test:

- Test a hypothesis, "Do new page results in better conversion or not?"
- Simulate user groups with respect to conversions
- Find the the p_value
- Double check and validate results and decide whether to reject the null hypothesis


#### Regression Approach:

- Explore two possible outcomes; 1) Keep the existing page; and/or, 2) Use the new page. Which webpage is better? How? Why? 
- Factoring user's geo-location of the users, determine if any specific country had an impact on conversion?
